# Sell items mod

Automatically sell items based on quality. For example, .sell green will sell all green (uncommon) items from bags, bank, equipped (customizable via .conf). Only items with sell price > 0 will be sold and player will be given the correct amount of gold. Can be used to sell those annoying grey items ;)
